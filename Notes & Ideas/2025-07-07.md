- Random Dataset for training: 50 % rnd patients ofmild, same for crit.
- Improve the Simulate_Bulk function
	- instead of getting limited by the lower amount of cells in one patient, sample the cells in the smaller patient sample up to the size of the larger patient sample
- For patient-wise mapping: 100 patients -> show errors in ROC-Curve
- Population Mapping: 
	- add transparancy to the dots
	- perhaps rm really small theta
	- change color bar to achieve higher differentiation between pos/neg
	- For final plot:
		- Whole UMAP with all cell types
		- zoom in only the good performing one (cl. monocytes)
	- gamma exchange with self.gamma in inference
		- test if performance bad else back to original
		- rm gamma_prime and sigmaSQ & adapt domain (all Jana)
- Download and discover CytoFlow Data as groundtruth for whole blood (x)
- DeconomiX in benchmark 
- scaden seperately train and test with saved sets
